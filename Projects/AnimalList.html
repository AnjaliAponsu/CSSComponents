                <h2>Lions</h2>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.
                     It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at 
                     the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a 
                     prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a 
                     few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
                      on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>

                <h1>Dogs</h1>
                <p class="des-project">The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant 
                    of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves 
                    during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by 
                    humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association 
                    with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>

                <h1>Cats</h1>
                <p class="des-project">Cats are small, carnivorous mammals that are often kept as pets. They are known for their agility,
                    playfulness, and ability to hunt vermin. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are descendants of wildcats and have been 
                    associated with humans for thousands of years.</p>

                    strong hind legs, and short fluffy tails. Rabbits are social animals and live in groups. They are herbivores, 
                    primarily feeding on grass, forbs, and leafy weeds.</p>
